# Askara AI ‚Äì Smart Exam Practice Tool

Askara AI is a smart exam prediction system that helps students prepare for exams faster and more effectively.  
It analyzes patterns from past exam papers and uses AI to generate likely future questions.  
Students can instantly view answers and ask for clarifications just like having a personal tutor.

---

## What It Does

- Predicts likely exam questions using past papers and topic modeling  
- Lets users generate one question at a time to simulate real exam practice  
- Provides instant answers using an AI model (GPT)  
- Offers follow-up clarifications when needed  
- Now supports a clean, interactive web UI with question history

## What's New (Updated Version)

This is an updated version of the original Askara AI project, which was previously built using Gradio.

We‚Äôve now implemented:  
- A fully custom React frontend (replacing Gradio)  
- A FastAPI backend to handle API requests securely  
- Improved UI/UX with scrolling, question flow, and clarification input  
- Cleaner project structure for production readiness  

The core prediction logic still follows the same method:  
Past papers ‚Üí Topic modeling ‚Üí Sampling ‚Üí GPT-4 ‚Üí Predicted questions

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
